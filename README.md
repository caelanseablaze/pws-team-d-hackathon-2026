# Adventure AID
Hello! This is the submission of **PAREF Woodrose School Senior Team D** to the 2026 Breaking Barriers, Building Bridges Hackathon. 

This is an app that lets users, primarily PWDs, rate public spaces and be rewarded with cute blobs.

Enjoy!

**NOTE:** As of 02/21/2026 11:34 PM, some files, particularly images, are not loading properly. It might just be taking a long time, but if images still do not appear we recommend downloading all the repository files to your device to test it locally. 

## Features
- You can rate two location in the "Map" page: PAREF Woodrose School and Alabang Country Club. Both locations display ratings that are not fully accurate to real life, but exist to demonstrate the system. Submitting a complete rating to a location for the first time awards a randomly-generated blob creature. You may submit an incomplete rating, but a blob will not be awarded unless it is complete.
- You can view collected creatures in the "Creatures" page. Blobs come with a name, a magical element, and a few unique traits that show on their sprites.
- The "Information" page contains a basic game tutorial and accessibility information based on Philippine laws.
- There are checkboxes in the "account" page that currently do nothing, but would be important in the future.
- Certain elements may have screen reader support, but that is currently untested.
- Elements resize responsively on various screen sizes.
- Pixel art and graphics, with shading!
